        <h3>THE STRONGER_August Strindberg_ </h3>
        <p>
                SCENE: _A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of
                cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plush, and a few chairs._<br>
                
                MRS. X. _enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
                pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.<br>
                
                MISS Y. _has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
                is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she
                exchanges it for a new one_.<br>
                
                MRS. X. Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
                lonely as a poor bachelor.<br>
               
                [MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
                her reading_.]<br>
               
                MRS. X. Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
                restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
                when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
                reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
                witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
                Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
                to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
                dear. <br>
               
                [_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_ MRS. X.,
                _and disappears again_. <br>
               
                MRS. X. [_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
                of Christmas presents._] See what I've bought for my tots. [_Picks up a
                doll._] What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
                eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
                pistol for Carl. <br>
                
                [_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ MISS Y. MISS Y. _starts as if
                frightened_.<br>
                
                MRS. X. Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
                did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
                were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
                in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
                it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
                didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
                matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.
                [_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._] Well, these are for my
                hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
                must have them on everything.
